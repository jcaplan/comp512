testbed description:
a)
Client:
single client on computer A
Middleware:
on computer B
3 RMs:
on computer C

Transaction type:
1.txn involving only one RM with same pattern :{"newcar,TxnId,location,1,10","newcar,TxnId,location,1,10","newcar,TxnId,location,1,10","deletecar,TxnId,location","deletecar,TxnId,location","deletecar,TxnId,location"}
2.txn involing all 3 RMs:
{"newcar,TxnId,location,1,10", "newroom,TxnId,location,1,10", "newflight,TxnId,0,1,10","deletecar,TxnId,location", "deleteroom,TxnId,location","deleteflight,TxnId,0"}

Measurement techniques:
Client first repeatedly execute txn of type 1 for 5000 times, adding up time spent between starting & commiting of each txn, then takes the average as response time.
Then it repeats the procedure for txn of type 2.

Observation:
Typical response time for transaction using single RM is between 1/5 to 1/8 lower than that of txn using all RMs.

b)
Clients: 
threads that concurrently executed on the computer A
Middleware:
on computer B
3 RMs:
on computer C

Measurement techniques:
For each #client and tps : each thread submit a txn every (1000.0/tps)*clientNumber milliseconds, with a random variation between +/-30% 
and measures time that elapses from starting the txn and getting the txn commited. 
Any time spent in retrying an aborted txn due to deadlock is counted towards the response time of that txn. 
Let N be total number of txns submitted by all clients in total. Each client submits around N/#client txns in total and calculate the average response time as its response time.
For fixed #client & tps, the final response time collected by the test is the average over all response time over all clients.

Transaction type:
Since the goal of part b) is to study the effect of tps & #client on response time, we keep using the same txn type of repeated pattern: 
{addCar,addRoom,addflight,reserveItinerary}.Since this type of txn writes to all RMs, it makes it possible to observe deadlock in the system when #client gets high.

Test range:
#client:
min:2,max:86,increment:4
tps:
min:1,max:61,increment:3
